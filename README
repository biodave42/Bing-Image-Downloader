BingImageDownloader.rb

Super simple script for downloading the image from www.bing.com to be saved on the local file system.

Usage: ./bingImageDownloader.rb [-s]
    -s, --sleep                      Sleep awhile before running
    -h, --help                       Display this text


The image file save path is hard coded in 'main', but not into the class.

Also writes a stdout and stderr log to the current directory

The sleep option for used for when running under launchctrl. Sometimes the network isn't available after the Mac has woken up from sleep until a few seconds. By which time launchctrl may have already fired the script, causing an error.
